# 🎥 Projection_mapping

**Projection_mapping** is a lightweight, high-performance API service built using **FastAPI**, designed to support interactive and dynamic **projection mapping** applications.

Projection mapping — also known as **spatial augmented reality** — turns physical surfaces or objects into dynamic visual displays by projecting digital content onto them. This project serves as the backend layer for controlling, configuring, and synchronizing projection parameters in real time.
